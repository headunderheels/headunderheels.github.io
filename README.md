# YETI Website Submission

Link: https://headunderheels.github.io/

For the most part, I will let the website do the talking. There's a lot here, so be sure to poke around and hover and click on everything. Please excuse the mess that is the backend on this webpage — I have no idea how to code efficiently.

Make sure to enable JavaScript.

Also, I would like to acknowledge the use of OpenAI's language model ChatGPT during the production of some UI elements and correcting JavaScript syntax errors (because I do not understand JS very well, but wanted to use it anyways).

This website is not optimized AT ALL. Please don't attempt to use it on a phone or mobile device.
