# YETI Website Submission
For the most part, I will let the website do the talking. There's a lot here, so be sure to poke around and hover and click on everything.

Make sure to enable JavaScript.

Also, I would like to acknowledge the use of OpenAI's language model ChatGPT during the production of some UI elements and correcting JavaScript syntax errors (because I do not understand JS very well, but wanted to use it anyways).

This website is not optimized AT ALL, and I am not an expert on accessibility properties, but still â€” try resizing the window.
